# Demand Generation

"Demand generation is the focus of targeted marketing programs to drive awareness and interest in a company's products and/or services.", Wikipedia

At Demand Science, our customers are always looking for high-quality lead data for their targeted sales campaigns. 

## Lead Data

Lead data provide information on two entities:

- Company: an organization or business looking to buy/use products and/or services. A company is composed of the following:
    - Name
    - Industry: what industry(ies) the company specializes in
    - Intent: what are the current buying intention(s) of the company
- Contact: an employee within the said company with the power to make decisions on what products/services the company should use. A contact is composed of the following:
    - Name
    - Email
    - LinkedIn
    - Quality score (Customer are always interested in contacts with a score greater than a certain threshold)

Another essential feature of a lead generation platform is exclusion lists. When customers search for contacts, they will provide a supression/exclusion list of their own contacts to be excluded from their search results.

## Objectives

The goal is to build a lead-generation service to achieve the following:

- Customers can search for contacts and companies using basic filtering params, then..
- They can buy/checkout the data afterwards
- Customers can provide their exclusion lists to be exclued from their search results
